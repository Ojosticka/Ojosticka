- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ojosticka
- 👀 I’m interested in a mix of Data and Programming, the goal is to be a data engineer (so i'm on course towards this path)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, improving my python, visualization skills, and delving into proper coding habits using data structures and algorithms. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that involves a lot of critical thinking in python, DSA, and data engineering.
